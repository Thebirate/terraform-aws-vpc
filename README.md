Module Description

Start with a clear, concise description of what the module creates.

    This Terraform module creates a standard AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets, an Internet Gateway, and a NAT Gateway. It's designed to be a reusable and highly available networking foundation for your AWS infrastructure.

Usage Example

Provide a simple, copy-and-paste example of how a user would call your module from a root module.
Terraform

module "vpc" {
  source = "github.com/your_github_username/terraform-aws-vpc" # Replace with your GitHub repo
  
  project_name = "my-awesome-project"
  vpc_cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  public_subnets = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24"]
  private_subnets = ["10.0.101.0/24", "10.0.102.0/24"]
  availability_zones = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]
}

Inputs

List all the input variables defined in your variables.tf file. This is often the most important part of the documentation. For each variable, include its name, a brief description, type, and default value if it has one.
Name	Description	Type	Default
project_name	The name of the project for resource tags.	string	n/a
vpc_cidr_block	The CIDR block for the VPC.	string	n/a
public_subnets	A list of CIDR blocks for the public subnets.	list(string)	n/a
private_subnets	A list of CIDR blocks for the private subnets.	list(string)	n/a
availability_zones	A list of Availability Zones to deploy subnets in.	list(string)	n/a

Outputs

List all the outputs defined in your outputs.tf file. This tells users what information they can retrieve from your module after it has been deployed.
Name	Description
vpc_id	The ID of the VPC.
public_subnet_ids	A list of the public subnet IDs.
private_subnet_ids	A list of the private subnet IDs.
